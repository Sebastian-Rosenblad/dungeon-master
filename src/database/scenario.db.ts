As an action, a character can touch the altar and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Religion) check. On a successful check, they receive the Elemental Blessing, which grants them resistance to one type of elemental damage (of their choice) for 1 hour. The Quetzali can also use the altar, so players should be cautious.","<b>Sconces of Sacred Fire:</b> Lining the chamber walls are sconces holding sacred flames that emit a flickering, multicolored light. As an action, a character can use a container or cloth to capture some of the sacred fire and throw it at an enemy.
