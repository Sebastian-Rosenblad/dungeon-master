The village elder, a wise old woman, gathers you all and reveals that several innocents have been kidnapped by the Quetzali, a bird-like race with a reputation for bringing death and destruction. The Quetzali plan to use these hostages in a sacrificial ritual to avert an ancient prophecy of doom. The elder implores you to embark on a quest to save the hostages and put an end to the Quetzali's ominous ritual. As a gesture of goodwill, the elder provides a rough map of the surrounding lands, highlighting the general location of the Quetzali's ritual site. You, understanding the gravity of the situation, accept the task and prepare to set out on your journey.","scenes":[{"name":"Negotiations","text":["As you embark on your journey, you follow the villagers' directions and soon find yourselves entering the lush, tropical forest. The sunlight filters through the foliage above, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air is filled with the sounds of wildlife and the distant rush of water from a nearby river. The undergrowth becomes thicker as you progress, making the path ahead more challenging to navigate. The atmosphere grows tense as you delve deeper into the forest, aware that the Quetzali might be lurking within the shadows, ready to protect their territory at any cost.","Introducing the characters.","As the players walk through the jungle the character with the highest passive perception hears loud voices arguing in Auran further inside the jungle.","If they decide to sneak up closer they must beat a DC 13 Stealth check or be noticed by the three Quetzali. Upon getting closer without being detected the players can see three Quetzali, two arguing and the third quietly watching. The two are arguing over the High Feather and his plans to sacrifice the prisoners in the ritual. Tlaloc calmly doesn't like the High Feather's plans while Xochitl is fiercly protective of the High Feather.","[bestiary]Tlaloc the Wise","[bestiary]Xochitl the Fierce","[bestiary]Atziri the Cunning","If the players are noticed before any hostile actions, a social encounters begin.

As the players move through the area, they must make Perception checks (DC 15) to spot the patches of quicksand. If they fail, they risk stepping into the quicksand and becoming trapped.","A character trapped in quicksand must make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to attempt to free themselves. On a successful check, they can move up to half their speed away from the quicksand. Other characters can attempt to help by using ropes, branches, or other methods, granting the trapped character advantage on their Strength (Athletics) check. However, characters assisting must also make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain their balance and avoid becoming trapped themselves. If a character remains trapped in quicksand for more than 10 rounds, they begin to suffocate."]},{"name":"Quetzali Patrol","text":["As the adventurers continue their journey towards the ancient temple, they find themselves traversing a dense, tropical forest. The sunlight filters through the foliage above, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air is filled with the sounds of wildlife and the distant rush of water from a nearby river. The undergrowth becomes thicker as they progress, making the path ahead more challenging to navigate. The atmosphere grows tense as the adventurers approach the temple's perimeter, aware that the Quetzali might be watching from the shadows.","If Atziri the Cunning guided the players through the jungle, she stops following them here, but gives them a dagger before she leaves. If the players asks her about the dagger, she tells them that they can keep it if they kill the High Feather, and if they die she hopes that the High Feather becomes angry with Xochitl since it is her dagger.","<b>Talon of the Windcaller:</b> This magical dagger is shaped like a Quetzali talon and crafted from a rare, enchanted metal. The blade is imbued with the power of wind and air, causing it to emit a faint breeze when wielded. When used to attack, the Talon of the Windcaller deals an additional 1d4 lightning damage on a successful hit. Additionally, as a bonus action, the wielder can cause the dagger to emit a strong gust of wind, pushing a creature within 15 feet up to 10 feet away. This ability can be used once per short or long rest.","The players face off against a Quetzali patrol, consisting of 3 Winged Scouts and a Skywarden. If Xochitl the Fierce stalked the players and isn't dead, she will roll for initiative after the first round is over and attack the players from 30ft behind them.","[bestiary]Skywarden","[bestiary]Winged Scout","[bestiary]Xochitl the Fierce","<b>Tree Platforms:</b> Scattered throughout the forest are a series of wooden platforms built high in the trees by the Quetzali. These platforms provide an advantageous position for winged scouts and skywardens to observe the area and launch aerial attacks. Climbing to a platform requires a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, while characters with a fly speed can reach them without a check. Perception checks and ranged attacks have a +2 while on the platform and the target is on the ground.","<b>Vine Bridges:</b> Connecting some of the tree platforms are narrow, vine bridges that sway precariously with each step. Crossing a vine bridge requires a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A character who fails the check falls to the ground and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet fallen.","<b>Dense Underbrush:</b> The thick undergrowth in the forest can provide cover for those who know how to use it. A character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide in the underbrush. The dense foliage also counts as difficult terrain, requiring an additional 5 feet of movement for each space traversed.","<b>River Crossing:</b> The nearby river has carved a winding path through the forest, and its banks are lined with slippery rocks and steep drop-offs. A character attempting to cross the river must make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to avoid being swept downstream. The river is also an ideal place for an ambush, as creatures hiding among the rocks and vegetation have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. There is one Vine Bridges that goes over the river.","<b>Ancient Statues:</b> The area surrounding the temple is dotted with ancient, weathered statues depicting Quetzali deities and warriors. Characters can use these statues for cover, granting them half or three-quarters cover depending on the statue's size. Additionally, a character can attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to topple a statue, potentially crushing creatures within a 5-foot radius. Creatures in the path of the falling statue must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone."]},{"name":"Elemental Alignment","text":["As the players enter the ancient Quetzali temple, they find themselves in a dimly lit chamber with walls adorned with intricate carvings depicting various elemental forces. The chamber has four large statues, each representing one of the four classical elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Positioned in the center of the room is a circular pedestal with slots for four distinct elemental symbols.","Each statue is holding a symbol that corresponds to its respective element: a stone for earth, a feather for air, a flame for fire, and a droplet for water. These symbols are removable and can be placed into the slots on the pedestal.","The puzzle requires the players to align the elemental symbols on the pedestal in a specific order that reflects the natural harmony of the elements. To uncover the correct sequence, they must carefully examine the carvings on the walls, which depict the relationships between the elements. The carvings reveal that:","<ul><li>Earth supports and nurtures life, represented by the growth of plants.</li><li>Air fans the flames of fire, represented by a feather blowing a gust of wind towards a raging fire.</li><li>Fire brings warmth and energy to life, represented by a flaming torch illuminating a dark cave.</li><li>Water extinguishes fire, represented by a wave crashing over a burning blaze.</li></ul>","Based on these clues, the players must deduce that the correct order for the elemental symbols on the pedestal is Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.","To solve the puzzle, the players must place the elemental symbols in the slots on the pedestal, following the order they have deduced from the carvings. Once they have arranged the symbols in the correct sequence (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), a hidden door in the chamber opens, leading further into the temple. As a reward for solving the puzzle, a gentle breeze imbues the players with the Elemental Blessing, granting them resistance to one type of elemental damage (of their choice) for the duration of their time within the temple. This boon will aid them in the upcoming encounters and the final boss fight."]},{"name":"The Defector","text":["The players walk into a room full of half painted paintings and a Quetzali in front of a stand, working on a painting. If the players are not hostile towards the Quetzali a social encounter starts.","[bestiary]Izel the Doubtful","Izel have three problems in varying severity, and he expresses the first one as soon as he notices the players. He is overdramatic and tells the players that he is ready to die since he can't live on with the guilt over not leaving the High Feather even though he is killing so many thinking and feeling being. If the players successfully convinces Izel that he may find a new family, the next segment start. If the players fail two skill checks Izel refuses to listen to the players anymore and charge them with a brush.","Izels second problem is that he is doubtful anyone else would allow him into their family, that other Quetzali find him \"overdramatic\" and \"soft\" while other beings only see a bloodthirsty bird of prey. If the players successfully convinces him that he may be taken in by another family, the last segment starts. If the players fail two skill checks Izel refuses to listen to the players anymore and tells them to leave or kill him, then goes back to painting.","Izels last problem is that he is scared of the High Feather and the rest of his family. He would like to stop him continuing with the ritual, but fear the retaliation from his family. If the players succeed instill calm or courage within Izel, he will guide the players through the rest of the temple, an join the players side for the final battle. If the players fail two skill checks Izel wont follow the players, but thanks them and give them a drawn map over the temple and where to go. He also gives three of them 7 temporary hit points before running out of the temple, never to be seen again."]},{"name":"The Windcaller's Trial","text":["If Izel gave the players a painting or decided to guide them, skip to the next scene.","As the players progress further into the ancient Quetzali temple, they stumble upon a large chamber with an open ceiling, where the wind howls and rain pours in. At the center of the chamber stands a Quetzali Windcaller, an imposing figure who wields control over the fierce winds and volatile weather. The Windcaller, sensing the intruders, prepares to harness the elements to protect the temple and thwart the adventurers.","[bestiary]Windcaller","<b>Powerful Gusts:</b> The Windcaller summons powerful gusts of wind that sweep across the chamber at random intervals. When a gust occurs, all creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. Flying creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw.","<b>Lightning Strikes:</b> The storm raging above the chamber intensifies as the Windcaller channels its energy. At the beginning of each round, the Dungeon Master rolls a d6. On a roll of 5 or 6, a lightning bolt strikes a random 5-foot square within the chamber. Any creature within that square must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.","<b>Flash Floods:</b> As the rain pours into the chamber, the water level begins to rise, creating flash flood conditions. At the beginning of each round, the Dungeon Master rolls a d6. On a roll of 1, the water level rises, turning the chamber's floor into difficult terrain. Creatures that are Small or smaller must make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check at the beginning of their turn or be restrained by the rushing water.","<b>Lightning Rods:</b> Scattered throughout the chamber are several tall, metallic lightning rods. Players can attempt a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check to deduce that these rods can be used to redirect lightning strikes. As an action, a player can position a rod in a specific location, causing any lightning strike within a 10-foot radius of the rod to target the rod instead of the creature in the affected square.","<b>Wind Barriers:</b> Along the walls of the chamber are a series of ancient mechanisms designed to control the flow of wind within the temple. As an action, a player can attempt a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check to activate one of these mechanisms, creating a 10-foot cube of calm air that provides shelter from the powerful gusts. Creatures within this area are immune to the effects of the gusts, and ranged attacks made through the cube have no disadvantage due to the wind. The calm air lasts for 1 minute or until the mechanism is deactivated or destroyed.","If the players kills the Windcaller and searches their bodi they find a magical whistle.","<b>Quetzali Wind Whistle:</b> This delicate, bird-shaped whistle is crafted from a rare, iridescent material and adorned with intricate carvings. When blown, the whistle produces a sound that is almost inaudible to the human ear, but it resonates with the power of wind and air. As an action, the user can blow the whistle to cast the \"Gust of Wind\" spell (spell save DC 14) without expending a spell slot. The Quetzali Wind Whistle can be used once per short or long rest."]},{"name":"High Feather's Ritual","text":["Before the ritual chamber the players arrive at the Chamber of the Quetzali Pantheon. Here they can learn about the environmental objects that will exist in the final battle.","<b>Elemental Altar:</b> The central altar radiates with the power of the elemental forces, providing a boon to those who can harness its energy. As an action, a character can touch the altar and make a DC 14 Wisdom (Religion) check. On a successful check, they receive the Elemental Blessing, which grants them resistance to one type of elemental damage (of their choice) for 1 hour. The Quetzali can also use the altar, so players should be cautious.","<b>Sconces of Sacred Fire:</b> Lining the chamber walls are sconces holding sacred flames that emit a flickering, multicolored light. As an action, a character can use a container or cloth to capture some of the sacred fire and throw it at an enemy. The target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be illuminated by the sacred fire, granting advantage on attacks against them for 1 minute. The Quetzali can also use the sacred fire.","<b>Pillars of Elemental Power:</b> Four massive pillars support the chamber's domed ceiling, each engraved with symbols representing earth, air, fire, and water. As an action, a character can touch one of the pillars and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, they gain the ability to cast a spell associated with the chosen element (such as earth tremor, gust of wind, burning hands, or create or destroy water) as a 1st-level spell without using a spell slot. The Quetzali can also harness the pillars' power.","<b>Crystals of Protection:</b> Scattered throughout the chamber are clusters of vibrant crystals that can provide temporary protection. As a bonus action, a character can touch a crystal cluster and gain a temporary +2 bonus to their Armor Class for 1 minute. The Quetzali can also use the crystals for protection.","As the players reach the inner sanctum of the ancient Quetzali temple, they find themselves in a vast, circular chamber with a high, domed ceiling. The room is adorned with intricate murals depicting the Quetzali pantheon and their elemental powers. A large, central altar occupies the center of the chamber, emitting a faint, otherworldly glow.","[bestiary]High Feather","[bestiary]Windcaller","<b>Lightning Strikes:</b> The storm raging above the chamber intensifies as the Windcaller channels its energy. At the beginning of each round, the Dungeon Master rolls a d6. On a roll of 5 or 6, a lightning bolt strikes a random 5-foot square within the chamber.

The remnants of their foes scatter and flee, seeking refuge from the party's might. The air around the altar, previously crackling with elemental energy, now becomes calm and still. A sense of peace settles over the once-dangerous chamber.","The players take a moment to catch their breath and tend to their wounds. They survey the sacred temple around them, realizing they have achieved a great victory by stopping the Quetzali from further endangering the village and the surrounding lands. As the adventurers begin to explore the temple, they discover valuable treasures and relics long hidden from the world. Their actions have uncovered a forgotten chapter of history, shedding light on the ancient culture of the Quetzali.","As the party leaves the temple, they find the once-hostile environment of the dense, tropical forest has changed. The animals seem less aggressive, and the plants appear more vibrant, as if the forest itself acknowledges the adventurers' success in restoring balance.","Upon returning to the village, the players are met with gratitude and relief. The villagers, thankful for the adventurers' courage and skill, celebrate their triumph with a grand feast in their honor. Tales of their heroic deeds spread far and wide, inspiring others to seek adventure and face the unknown.","As the sun sets on another day, the adventurers set their sights on the horizon, knowing that they have made a lasting impact on the world around them. They have faced danger, embraced their strengths, and forged bonds that will last a lifetime.
