Drawing inspiration from the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Order reveres the sun as the ultimate symbol of life, power, and prosperity. They believe that the sun god, Ra'Shar, created the world and continues to watch over it, granting favor to those who worship him devoutly and follow his teachings.","[item]Imhotep-Ka","The most powerful person within the Order is the High Sun Priest, a respected and authoritative figure who oversees all religious and administrative matters within the organization. The current High Sun Priest is named Imhotep-Ka, an elderly but sharp-minded leader known for his wisdom and unwavering devotion to Ra'Shar. Beneath Imhotep-Ka, there is a council of senior priests called the Sun Wardens, who manage various aspects of the Order's daily affairs, such as rituals, education, and enforcement of religious laws.","The Order's beliefs are based on a series of sacred texts that outline a strict code of conduct and a hierarchy of commandments. These texts emphasize the importance of loyalty to the sun god, adherence to tradition, and the subservience of the individual to the greater good. They also contain a number of outdated and controversial teachings regarding social norms, gender roles, and moral judgments, which Nehk-Set seeks to reform.","The common folk of Ankhapur are greatly affected by the Order's presence, as the organization controls most aspects of daily life. Religious ceremonies, festivals, and worship services play a significant role in the community, and many citizens look to the Order for guidance in their personal lives. However, the Order's more controversial teachings have led to some tension among the population, with some citizens questioning the morality and relevance of certain doctrines.","Ranks within the Order of the Sacred Sun are as follows:","<ul><li>High Sun Priest: The supreme leader of the Order, responsible for overseeing all religious and administrative affairs.</li><li>Sun Wardens: The council of senior priests who assist the High Sun Priest in managing the Order's daily operations.</li><li>Solar Scribes: A group of learned scholars who maintain and interpret the sacred texts and religious laws.</li><li>Sun Disciples: Dedicated priests and priestesses who lead local worship services, perform rituals, and provide spiritual guidance to the community.</li><li>Dawnbringers: A specialized order of holy warriors who protect the Order's interests, enforce religious laws, and safeguard holy sites.</li><li>Initiates: Newcomers to the Order who are in training to become Sun Disciples or Dawnbringers, depending on their skills and inclinations.</li></ul>","Though the Order of the Sacred Sun wields considerable power and influence within the city of Ankhapur, the players' actions during their investigation into the rewritten texts have the potential to reshape the organization's future, either by upholding its traditional beliefs or by encouraging much-needed reform."]}]}];
