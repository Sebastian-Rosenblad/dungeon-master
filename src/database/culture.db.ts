Their sharp, beak-like mouths and clawed hands and feet make them skilled aerial combatants. These enchanting beings inhabit a lush, vibrant, and mountainous region with dense forests and hidden valleys, providing them with natural defenses and resources to support their flourishing culture.","Deeply rooted in the worship of the god Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, the Quetzali hold wisdom, creativity, and the duality of life and death in high regard. They are fiercely protective of the sacred temples and artifacts in their domain, believing them to hold the key to maintaining balance in the world. The Quetzali view any encroachment upon their territory as a threat to this balance and will defend it with their lives. Outsiders may perceive their hostility as destructive, but within their culture, it is a necessary sacrifice to preserve their sacred heritage.","Within the Quetzali society, several important titles and jobs can be found, such as the High Feather, the spiritual and political leader; Skywardens, members of the elite guard; Windcallers, skilled shamans capable of harnessing the power of the wind; Feather Artists, masters of ancient Quetzali art forms; and Winged Scouts, swift and agile reconnaissance experts. Quetzali form strong bonds with various creatures in their environment, including the melodious Tlapitzalli birds, the curious Coaalt reptiles, and the loyal Xochitl Hounds.","The environment the Quetzali inhabit is rich in biodiversity, with an abundance of plants, fruits, and animals. The towering trees and the diverse flora provide sustenance and resources for the Quetzali and their pets, while the landscape's rugged terrain and intricate cave systems serve as a natural fortress against potential threats. The Quetzali have developed a unique architectural style that blends seamlessly with their surroundings, using natural materials such as stone, wood, and clay to create their sacred temples and dwellings.","In harmony with their environment, the Quetzali have built a thriving society that balances both the spiritual and physical realms, maintaining a deep connection with the land and its countless secrets. Their wisdom, combined with their unwavering dedication to their divine mission, makes the Quetzali a unique and awe-inspiring fantasy race.","<b>Male names:</b> Atl, Chimalli, Cuauhtli, Eztli, Huitzilin, Ichtaca, Itzcoatl, Matlal, Necalli, Ollin, Patli, Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, Tonauac, Xipil, Yaretzi, Zolin, Acolmiztli, Chimalpopoca, Yaotl","<b>Female names:</b> Acatl, Citlali, Coatl, Itzel, Malinal, Mazatl, Necahual, Nochtli, Quetzalli, Tlalli, Xiuhtonal, Yaretzi, Zeltzin, Acuecucyoticihuati, Cihuacoatl, Ilancueitl, Malintzin, Temilotzin, Tlacaeleltzin, Xochiquetzal","<b>Unisex names</b>:","<b>Surnames:</b>","<b>Tribe names:</b>"]},{"name":"Bestiary","text":["This is a list of all Quetzalis and their most common pets.","[bestiary_tags]quetzali"]},{"name":"New chapter","text":[""]}]}];
